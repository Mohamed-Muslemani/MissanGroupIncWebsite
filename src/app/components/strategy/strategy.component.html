      <h5 class="sub-heading">PUTTING <strong>SAFETY FIRST</strong></h5>
      <p>
        Safety is our most important responsibility. In 2017, MISSAN co-founded the Building Responsibly coalition to develop and drive stronger worker safety and productivity standards for construction and engineering projects, as well as their supply chains, with a focus on international human rights.

      <h5 class="sub-heading mt-4">DELIVERING <strong>GREATER VALUE</strong></h5>
      <p>
        We also pressed forward with efforts to meet our customers’ desire for increased value. Project owners worldwide today face intense pressures driven by competition, the need for capital efficiency, the speed of innovation, and demands for sustainable growth and development.
        <br><br>
        Our goal is to become more agile, responsive, and efficient at meeting their needs. Through technology innovation, process improvements, and discipline, we are working to reduce project delivery costs by 20 percent and improve schedule performance by 30 percent — gains that will translate into direct benefits for customers.
